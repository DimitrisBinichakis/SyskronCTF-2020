### *2020 Syskron Security CTF*

For this event a large part of our team was comprised of new players , with no prior experience in 
CTF competitions . I'd like to personally thank everyone of them , for taking a leap of faith and
trying out a CTF for themselves , no matter how scary it seemed at first .
